    Since our project is a **docker compose application** that runs **locally**, in order to be able to use a form of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery **(CI/CD)** we decided to take advantage of **Docker Hub** and **[Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)**. 

    More specifically we created a **Docker Hub** repository named **[`roadaccidentsmlops24`](https://hub.docker.com/u/roadaccidentsmlops24)** and we used **Github Actions** to **build and push** our application's Docker images.
    
    There are 3 Dockerfiles used by this application:  

    * [`roadaccidentsmlops24/airflowdb`](https://github.com/DataScientest-Studio/may24_bmlops_accidents/blob/master/python-packages/airflowdb.Dockerfile) which is used as the base image of [Airflow running in docker compose](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/docker-compose/index.html).
    * [`roadaccidentsmlops24/model_api`](https://github.com/DataScientest-Studio/may24_bmlops_accidents/blob/master/python-packages/model_api/Dockerfile) which is used for serving a trained ML model and user authorization purposes.
    * [`roadaccidentsmlops24/accidents_ui`](https://github.com/DataScientest-Studio/may24_bmlops_accidents/blob/master/python-packages/green_light_ui/Dockerfile) which is used to provide a UI for our project.
    
    
    When the user starts the application in **`production` mode** using the **[`PROD-docker-compose-up.sh`](https://github.com/DataScientest-Studio/may24_bmlops_accidents/blob/master/PROD-docker-compose-up.sh)** 
    script, the aforementioned **Docker images will be pulled** from the [`roadaccidentsmlops24`](https://hub.docker.com/u/roadaccidentsmlops24) Docker Hub repo.
    
    > Note: There is also the possibility to run the application in **`development` mode** using the **[`DEV-docker-compose-up.sh`](https://github.com/DataScientest-Studio/may24_bmlops_accidents/blob/master/DEV-docker-compose-up.sh)
    script**. In this case the aforementioned Docker images **will not be pulled** from the `roadaccidentsmlops24` Docker hub repo but **instead the local Dockerfiles will used**
    to build the Docker images prior to running `docker compose up -d`.

    > A specific release (`tag`) version can be used when starting the Docker Compose app in `production` mode, by setting the environment variable `GLS_TAG` 
    (`GLS` is an abbrv. of Green Light Services). 
    
    > If a specific release version is requested then Docker compose will pull the images from Docker hub that correspond
    the specified tag. For example if one would like to start the application using the release version `v0.0.4`:

        * GLS_TAG="v0.0.4" DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker compose up -d # OR
        * GLS_TAG="v0.0.4" ./PROD-docker-compose-up.sh

    > If the `GLS_TAG` environment variable is not set, then the `latest` tag will be used.
    
    > When running the application in the `development` mode using the `DEV-docker-compose-up.sh`, the environment variable `GLS_TAG` has no effect. In `development` mode, the Docker images are build using the local `Dockerfiles` instead of being pulled from the Docker Hub.""")
